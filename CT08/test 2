# Question 2
# You are given a dictionary called customer_spending, 
# which contains the names of customers (as keys) and 
# the total amount they spent in a month (as values).

# Your tasks are:
# 1. Identify customers who spent more than $1000.
#    - Add them to a dictionary called vip.
#    - Print a message for each VIP customer:
#      "Hi , you are now a VIP! Congratulations!"

# 2. Identify customers who spent less than or equal to $1000.
#    - Add them to a dictionary called non_vip.
#    - Print a message for each non-VIP customer indicating 
#      how much more they need to spend:
#      "Hi , spend $ more to become a VIP member!"

# Example Output:
# Hi Bob, you are now a VIP! Congratulations!
# Hi Charlie, spend $500 more to become a VIP member!

# Task: Complete the code below

customer_spending = {
    "Alice": 950, "Bob": 1200, "Charlie": 500, 
    "Diana": 1800, "Ethan": 2200, "Fiona": 700,

    "Matt": 452, "Kristen": 985, "Johnson": 785, 
    "Charles": 2352, "Tommy": 741, "Laura": 689 }

# Part 1:

# add vip customers to vip dictionary
# add non vip customers to non_vip dictionary

# Write your code here, add more space as required
vip = {}
non_vip = {}
for customer, spent in customer_spending.items():
    if spent > 1000:
        vip[customer] = amount
        print("Hi, you are now a vip member!")
    el
